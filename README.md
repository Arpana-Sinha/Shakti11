Project Description
Shakti aims to instil a sense of security among females in our society and help them become more strong in their day to day lives.


The Problem statement
The lack of accessible and reliable resources for women's safety and mental health continues to be a pressing issue. Many individuals face difficulties in finding immediate help in emergencies, seeking mental health support, and accessing reliable safety resources. This project aims to develop an integrated platform that provides quick emergency assistance, a community support forum, and a comprehensive safety resource library, empowering individuals to take control of their well-being and safety. Through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, the platform seeks to offer timely and effective solutions, fostering a safer and more supportive environment for users.

The Solution
The solution is an integrated online platform offering three main features:

Emergency Quick Help: Provides immediate access to emergency contacts and support services.
Community Support Forum: A space for users to engage in discussions, share experiences, and receive guidance on mental health and safety.
Safety Resource Library: A collection of informative resources on personal safety, mental health, and self-care.
The platform aims to create a user-friendly, accessible space for individuals to find timely support, fostering safety and well-being in one place.
